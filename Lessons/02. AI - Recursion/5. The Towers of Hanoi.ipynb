    "Now let's try to write a Python program to solve this puzzle. As you might have guessed, it's going to be a recursive function. First declare the function hanoi with four parameters. The first one is the number of disks to be moved (n), the second is the starting rod (source), the third parameter is the middle rod (we will call this one auxiliary) and the last parameter is the goal rod (destination). So the purpose of our function is to move *n* disks from *source* to *destination* using *auxiliary* as helper. If we named the three rods \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\" and we would like to play the game with 5 disks, the solution up to now would be:\n",

    "Actually the solution is really simple. Moving n disks from source to destination using auxiliary can be done in three steps:\n",
