    "Brief Assignment: Use simpleai to solve cryptoarithmetic puzzles. \n",
    "The assignment objective is to develop a program that can solve cryptarithmetic puzzles. Cryptarithmetic puzzles are word problems that use numbers to represent letters, and the goal is to find the correct numerical values for the letters so that the equation in the puzzle is true. The program should allow the user to enter the cryptarithmetic puzzle as input, and the program will then generate the appropriate constraints and solve them to generate a solution. The program should also be well-commented and have a clear structure.\n",
