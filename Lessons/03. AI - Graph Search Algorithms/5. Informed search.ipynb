    "A heuristic is a rule of thumb which leads us to the probable solution. Most problems in Artificial Intelligence are of exponential nature and have many possible solutions. You do not know exactly which solutions are correct and checking all the solutions would be very expensive.\n",

    "Thus, the use of a heuristic narrows down the search for a solution and eliminates the wrong options. The method of using a heuristic to lead the search in search space is called informed search or heuristic search. Heuristic techniques are very useful because the search can be boosted when you use them.\n",

    "# The A* algorithm is a search algorithm that finds the shortest or optimal path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. The extra information that the A* algorithm needs to work properly is a **heuristic function** . A heuristic function is a function that estimates the cost or distance from any node to the goal node. The heuristic function helps the A* algorithm to prioritize the nodes that are more likely to lead to the goal, and avoid exploring nodes that are far away from the goal. The heuristic function should be **admissible** and **consistent** , meaning that it should never overestimate the actual cost or distance, and it should satisfy the triangle inequality property. For example, if we have a graph that represents a map of cities, and we want to find the shortest route from one city to another, we can use the straight-line distance between the cities as a heuristic function, since it is always lower than or equal to the actual road distance.\n",

    "Informed search refers to a search strategy that attempts to optimize the search problem based on a given heuristic function or a cost measure. A heuristic is a rule of thumb that estimates how close a state is to the goal state.
